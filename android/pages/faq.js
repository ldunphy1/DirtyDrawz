Dirty Drawz is not responsible for damaged caused by the owner but does offer a insurance program that will protect against pens, gum and things of that nature left in the laundry.'

If you feel comfortable leaving your laundry in a common area or downstairs at the entrance, you can, but we are not responsible for any loss until our employees receive your bag. Dirty Drawz offers a special service that can help with this if you find it a problem. We offer a reminder call to tell you that it is a laundry day for you and that we are ready to pick-up your laundry. We also offer a door-to-door service that leaves the bag right outside your dorm room, apartment, etc.'
